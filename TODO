- [x] Fix CTC decoding issue for aberrant sample in VoxPopuli
- [ ] Create interleaved dataset with VoxPopuli
- [ ] Write converter script for old datasets containing alignments and DSUs (MLS)
    - [ ] -> run this converter script on MLS
    - [ ] -> run this converter script on GigaSpeech
- [ ] As a check: Create an interleaved dataset with the MLS aligned speech-text data that you converted


- [x] Check where TEXT_KEY_DEFAULT is being used and if it can be uniformly removed

Easy:
- [x] Rename script to uromanize.py
- [x] move segment_tokens.py and align_and_segment.py - as well as possibly others - to ./scripts/auxiliary/ subdirectory or similar
- [x] Rename generate_interleaved_data.py to interleave_data.py
- [x] finally: Ensure the pre-commit works and formats - and in particular isorts - everything that has been changed


- later: make hubert encoding optional in align_and_hubert_encode.py
- find a better name for align_and_hubert_encode.py
