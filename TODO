- [ ] Fix CTC decoding issue for aberrant sample in VoxPopuli
- [ ] Create interleaved dataset with VoxPopuli
- [ ] As a check: Create an interleaved dataset with the MLS aligned speech-text data that you converted


I've made --text-key required in uromanization_mp.py
i.e. `parser.add_argument("--text-key", type=str, required=True, help="Text field key in *input* JSON lines file.")`

-> Check where TEXT_KEY_DEFAULT is being used and if it can be uniformly removed

- Rename script to uromanize.py
- Write converter script for old datasets containing alignments and DSUs (MLS)
-> run this converter script

- move segment_tokens.py and align_and_segment.py - as well as possibly others - to ./scripts/auxiliary/ subdirectory or similar

- Rename generate_interleaved_data.py to interleave_data.py

- [x] finally: Ensure the pre-commit works and formats - and in particular isorts - everything that has been changed

- later: make hubert encoding optional in align_and_hubert_encode.py
- find a better name for align_and_hubert_encode.py
